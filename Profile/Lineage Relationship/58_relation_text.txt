 Recently, we discovered a bot that combines the capabilities of Tsunami (also known as Kaiten) and Gafgyt
 Based on artifacts found in the code, the authors call this new malware “KTN-Remastered” or “KTN-RM”
A prominent feature of Linux/Gafgyt is telnet scanning
Most of these capabilities are from Linux/Tsunami with the remainder from Linux/Gafgyt
 Analysis reveal the description of that command by the malware author is correct: it is indeed an improved version Gafgyt’s telnet scanner
2 is the fact that it also executes a wget/tftp command to download a shell script that downloads the bot binaries, just like Gafgyt usually does
The shell script is distributed via another server, which was also providing the popular Gafgyt bots
Perhaps it is a way to take revenge: MalwareMustDie is publishing a lot of details about Gafgyt, Tsunami and so on
 Vor kurzem erst entdeckten wir einen Bot, der die Fähigkeiten von Tsunami (auch als Kaiten bekannt) und Gafgyt kombiniert
 Vor kurzem erst entdeckten wir einen Bot, der die Fähigkeiten von Tsunami (auch als Kaiten bekannt) und Gafgyt kombiniert
 Anhand im Code wird die Malware „KTN-Remastered” oder „KTN-RM” genannt
Ein besonderes Merkmal von Linux/Gafgyt ist der Telnet-Scan
Die meisten Fähigkeiten der Malware sind von Linux/Tsunami adaptiert – ein kleiner Rest auch von Linux/Gafgyt
 Analysen zeigen, dass die Beschreibung des Befehls durch den Malware-Autor richtig ist: Es ist in der Tat eine verbesserte Version des Gafgyt Telnet- Scanners
2 ist die Tatsache, dass es auch einen wget/tftp Befehl ausführt, um ein SHELL-Skript herunterzuladen, das wiederum die Bot Binärdateien herunterlädt – was Gafgyt normalerweise ebenfalls tut
Das Shell-Skript wird über einen anderen Server verteilt, der auch die bekannten Gafgyt bots zur Verfügung stellt
Vielleicht ein kleiner Racheakt: MalwareMustDie veröffentlicht jede Menge Details über Gafgyt, Tsunami und so weiter
Kaiten, an Internet Relay Chat (IRC)-controlled malware typically used to carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, has returned, in a stronger configuration
 “Recently, we discovered a bot that combines the capabilities of Tsunami (also known as Kaiten) and Gafgyt
 Based on artifacts found in the code, the authors call this new malware KTN-Remastered or KTN-RM
Based primarily on Linux/Gafgyt’s telnet scanning, the new versions improve on the spreading mechanism by carrying downloader executable binaries for embedded platforms such as routers and other connected devices

A new strain of malware targeting Linux systems, dubbed "Linux/Shishiga," could morph into a dangerous security threat
Eset on Tuesday disclosed the threat, which represents a new Lua family unrelated to previously seen LuaBot malware
Linux/Shishiga uses four different protocols -- SSH, Telnet, HTTP and BitTorrent -- and Lua scripts for modularity, wrote Detection Engineer Michal Malik and the Eset research team in an online post
Linux/Shishiga "uses a series of modules in a scripting language called 'Lua,' which gives it a more flexible design," he told LinuxInsider
Linux/Shishiga targets GNU/Linux systems using a common infection vector based on brute-forcing weak credentials on a built-in password list
Eset found several binaries of Linux/Shishiga for various architectures, including MIPS (both big- and little-endian), ARM (armv4l), i686, and PowerPC, which are commonly used in IoT devices, Malik and the Eset research team noted
Shishiga's Anatomy
Linux/Shishiga is a binary packed with UPX (ultimate packer for executables) 3
 The UPX tool potentially has trouble unpacking it because Shishiga adds data at the end of the packed file
Despite a striking similarity to LuaBot instances that spread through weak Telnet and SSH credentials, Linux/Shishiga is different, according to Malik and the Eset researchers
Shishiga still might evolve and become more widespread, they said
Shishiga looks like it is targeted toward data centers or IoT devices, he told LinuxInsider
 "Also, data centers hold crown jewel targets, and if attackers use Shishiga successfully against a data center, enterprises will have a difficult time finding their traces unless they have some solution that analyzes inside the VM activity, and east-west traffic
To prevent your devices from being infected by Shishiga and similar worms, you should not use default Telnet and SSH credentials, suggested Malik and the Eset research team

In the past, other Linux malware families that were used to transform infected hosts into proxy servers and relay malicious traffic include the likes of Moose, LuaBot and NyaDrop
 The security researchers have named this malware as “Linux/Shishiga” which utilizes four different protocols according to Eset research team
 Michal Malik of Eset writes in his blog post that “Linux/Shishiga (meaning female swamp (or forest) creature in the Russian language) is a binary packed with UPX (ultimate packer for executables) 3
 The researchers who discovered LuaBot botnet defined it as “the most advanced botnet hitting Linux-based IoT devices”:
 It’s safe to say that Linux/Shishiga is a similar version of Linux/Moose
According to security researchers, Linux/Shishiga is still a work in progress, and we might get to see some evolved forms of it pretty soon
 DO NOT use default Telnet and SSH credentials, instead use a strong password! SSH stands for Secure Shell, and it’s a secure way to remotely access a site’s server however in Shishiga’s case situation is different
Botnets-for-hire, such as Lizard Squad's LizardStresser tool, are already well established
