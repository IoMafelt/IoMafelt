Wifatch router virus may turn out be an unusual case of a cybercriminal working to defend consumers against other malware rather than doing any direct damage or stealing data
Wifatch, which has also been called Zollard and Reincarna, has been active since for the last two years
Wifatch router virus is actually an attempt to ward off government surveillance from agencies such as the National Security Agency (NSA)
Wifatch is widespread across tens of thousands of devices, but there has yet to be a concrete estimate
Wifatch is well aware of how a home router can be used to distribute updates without the ownerâ€™s permission
Wifatch primarily checks Telnet ports for suspicious activity and, if necessary, renders it inoperable
Wifatch a debt of gratitude, leaving security up to those that sneak their way into devices is a sure way to wind up paying dearly later on

Aidra targets smaller devices, specifically cable and DSL modems
 Whoever authored Darlloz obviously believed that Aidra infections were so widespread that it posed a potential threat to their own malware
The company also says, "Other Linux malware, such as the Tsunami backdoor, has been causing trouble for several years now and can be easily modified for attacks against IoT devices
 The detection systems of AV-TEST first detected the Tsunami malicious code in the year 2003
 Although, at that time, practically no IoT devices existed, the Linux backdoor already offered attack functions which even today would be suitable for virtually unprotected attacks on routers: In this manner, Tsunami can download additional malicious code onto infected devices and thus make devices remote controllable for criminals
