“The idea of the actor as a blank slate is still limited too often to white actors who are overwhelmingly cast and paid to play a wide range of roles from which actors of color are precluded by virtue of their specificity,” said Jennifer Brody, Stanford professor and department chair of the school’s theater & performance studies

 But unlike previous IoT attacks, which exploited a single vulnerability, new IoT botnets such as Reaper and Hajime are able to target multiple vulnerabilities simultaneously
 Reaper’s flexible framework, built on a Lua engine and scripts, means that instead of the static, preprogrammed attacks of previous IoT exploits, its code can be easily updated
 For example, Reaper exploit volume in early October was able to spike from 50K to 2
 On April 28, Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 flagged a new variant of the Linux botnet Muhstik that exploits the vulnerability and compromises Linux servers and IoT devices for cryptomining and DDoS attacks
 Other software loadouts included DoFloo and Mayday (also DDOS tools) as well as Skynet, a backdoor program
In January, Brian Krebs reported on the LizardStresser attack service "powered mostly by thousands of hacked home Internet routers
Black malware, as well as additional malware files, including Dofloo and Mayday, which are also used for DDoS attacks
A -- as well as Dofloo and Mayday, all previously used for DDoS attacks
Based on the research results, it is possible that multiple individuals or groups exploit the insecurity of the devices because Incapsula found other DoS kits, such as Dofloo and Mayday, although in a much smaller percentage, 5

The CSA said out of 470 malware variants detected in 2018, five – Gamarue, Conficker, Mirai, WannaCry and Gamut – accounted for over half of the observed infections
