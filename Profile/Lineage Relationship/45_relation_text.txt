Utilisé depuis 2012 pour exfiltrer discrètement des données gouvernementales et d’individus dans des pays en guerre ou politiquement instables (Irak, Somalie, Afghanistan, Libye, RDC, Yémen…), le logiciel de cyberespionnage (malware) Slingshot continue d’être actif (au moins une centaine de lésés) dans les pays les plus instables du Moyen-Orient et d’Afrique
 Dénommé Roaming Mantis, le logiciel malveillant a pour objectif de subtiliser des informations comme des identifiants, ainsi que donner aux pirates un contrôle intégral des appareils infectés
Duqu was discovered September 2011 and is believed to be closely related to the infamous Stuxnet worm, which resulted in the destruction of Iranian centrifuges
 Indeed, many say that Duqu borrows much of the same source code as Stuxnet
 It was called Reaper
While devices infected with Mirai continued to operate as normal, that wasn't the case for those who found their IoT products infected with BrickerBot, a form of IoT malware that resulted in Homeland Security's Cyber Emergency Response Team (CERT) issuing new warnings
 Devices infected with BrickerBot have their storage corrupted, leading them to be completely unusable and irrecoverable
Stuxnet is generally regarded as the first instance of malware designed to spy on and subvert industrial systems and in 2010 it infiltrated Iran's nuclear program, infecting uranium centrifuges and irreparably damaging systems
While no state has officially taken credit for the attacks, it's believed Stuxnet was the work of US and Israeli cyber forces
Stuxnet was one of the most advanced malware attacks in history
It has been almost seven years since Stuxnet first made headlines for its devastating attack on Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges
The years haven't made it less relevant though—it's still an important topic due to the fact the exploit Stuxnet took advantage of still ranked among the most widely used in 2016
 Microsoft patched the exploit, CVE-2010-2568, in 2010, but malware that exploits it continues to live on—a prime example of why Stuxnet is still relevant
Zero Days, a 2016 documentary on Stuxnet, helped cement the malware into public consciousness
 Stuxnet has become synonymous with cyberattacks and cyberwarfare and questions continue to abound about its origin and the scope of its targets
TechRepublic's smart person's guide about Stuxnet is a quick introduction to this government-created malware, as well as a "living" guide that will be updated periodically as news about its evolution and misuse occur
What is Stuxnet? Stuxnet is a computer worm designed to disrupt the operation of programmable logic controllers (PLCs)

 When did Stuxnet happen? Stuxnet's outbreak began in early 2010, and updates were pushed to it from its C&C servers over the course of several months
 There is evidence to suggest that Stuxnet precursors were being used as early as 2007 to target Iran's burgeoning nuclear program and pave the way for the larger Stuxnet attack

 Who did Stuxnet affect? Stuxnet's effect was felt most strongly in Iran, where over 60% of infections were located
 While there's no confirmation of the breadth of the damage in Iran, many experts believe Stuxnet destroyed 1,000 centrifuges
 Stuxnet's impact on the rest of the world was negligible

 Why does Stuxnet matter? Stuxnet's command and control (C&C) servers may be offline, and it's no longer being spread, but the security community can still learn a lot from the malware attack
 Stuxnet specifically targeted industrial machines; it was designed to spread to air-gapped networks; and it proved that attacking infrastructure is possible
What is Stuxnet?
Stuxnet was malware that was able to spread without a host file, making it a worm
Stuxnet spreads from machine to machine while looking for Siemen's STEP 7 software used to control PLCs
 Once it locates a machine with STEP 7 installed on it, Stuxnet begins to feed false information to the PLC, intercepting the data the PLC generates using the false information, and reporting normal operation states back to STEP 7 so that it appears as if everything is normal
Stuxnet is incredibly sophisticated—it used four separate zero-day attacks (including CVE-2010-2568) to infiltrate systems and was precision built to only do damage to Siemens industrial control systems
Researchers from Symantec have found evidence that Stuxnet was deployed against Iran's nuclear program as early as 2007, but that backdating of its birth was made well after Stuxnet's 2010 discovery when it was used to attack a nuclear facility in Iran
As more evidence about the complexity of Stuxnet emerged, popular opinion began to solidify around it being built with the support of a national government
 Since then it has been reported that Stuxnet was the work of a joint US-Israeli cyberwarfare group, though absolute proof remains nonexistent
When did Stuxnet happen?
Stuxnet was discovered in 2010, but it actually has a much more interesting timeline that goes back several years earlier
 Several pieces of precursor malware, Duqu and Conficker, were launched in advance and were crucial in the development and spread of Stuxnet
After targeting Iranian systems Stuxnet received several updates from its C&C servers before the C&C servers were discovered, blocked, and eventually taken offline
 Stuxnet infections were purged over the next several months
Who did Stuxnet affect?
Stuxnet's primary victim was Iran—around 60% of the computers it infected were located in the country
 Indonesia had 18% and India 8% of Stuxnet infections, and other nations were affected in the low single-digit percents
The Iranian nuclear program is widely believed to have been the primary target of Stuxnet, and while Iran may have denied Stuxnet's effect on its nuclear centrifuges, the sudden failure of over 1,000 of them at an enrichment facility in Natanz, Iran, has led security analysts to conclude that Stuxnet was the culprit
Why does Stuxnet matter?
Stuxnet itself doesn't really matter anymore
 Stuxnet's heydey has long since passed; its C&C servers are offline; and whatever government may have built it has abandoned it
What matters is what Stuxnet revealed about the potential sophistication of malware and how effectively it could cripple industries and infrastructure
Let's break down what Stuxnet revealed to the world about the capabilities of malware
Stuxnet was incredibly effective in its targeting of control systems
It was, according to many analysts, created by a state actor, and while Stuxnet was not the first cyberwar attack in history it was arguably the most sophisticated to date
Stuxnet was designed to be initially delivered via USB drive to ensure it could infect air-gapped networks
 Once Stuxnet was on a system, it was designed to spread rapidly, quickly searching out computers with control over Siemens software and PLCs
While Stuxnet may be dead, its autopsied code is easily found online, which means its innovations are freely available
 Stuxnet's intended purpose (i
The exploit that enabled Stuxnet to spread continues to be one of the most targeted exploits in malware seven years later, and that's a bad sign for the security of organizations running software that controls industrial hardware
ESET, as part of its reporting on Stuxnet, said it "was a breakthrough event that should have served as a wake up call for all those involved in security of industrial systems
" But with at least one of the exploits Stuxnet used still common it's clear that it wasn't the wake-up call cybersecurity professionals hoped for
It's only a matter of time before the narrowly-targeted Stuxnet reappears in a similar, much more devastating form
 As with any other security threat, attacks like those that could follow in Stuxnet's footsteps can be avoided by keeping software up to date
 This changed with Stuxnet in 2010 (and spin-offs later that year including Duqu and Flame)
'Reaper': The Professional Bot Herders Thingbot
 If you were the world’s best Internet of Things botnet builder and you wanted to show the world how well-crafted an IoT botnet could be, Reaper is what you’d build
The interesting aspect of Reaper is not its current size, but its engineering, and therefore its potential
 But from a pure research perspective, we’re interested in how Reaper is spreading
 Instead of targeting weak auth like a common thingbot, Reaper weaponizes nine (and counting) different IoT vulnerabilities
Brian Krebs puts the current size of Reaper at over 1M IoT devices
 The reason Reaper could get so big is that, unlike its predecessors, Mirai and Persirai, Reaper uses multiple attack vectors
 Persirai used the blank username+password combo, which, frankly, we think is such a doofus security error on the part of the manufacturer that we feel it barely deserves to have a CVE
Reaper is almost showing off by not even trying the password cracking, and instead just exploiting different vulnerabilities (RCE’s, web shells, etc
Reports on the “size” of Reaper vary
 We’ve scanned 750,000 unique devices that match the nine vulnerabilities currently exploited by Reaper
 We don’t know which of them are actually infected, but there’s no reason that Reaper itself couldn’t infect them, unless its authors didn’t want it to
The nine vulnerabilities currently used by Reaper are fairly rudimentary, as vulnerabilities go
 If the thingbot authors were to include a few dozen, existing vulnerabilities that fit Reaper’s device targeting profile, we think they could grow the thingbot an additional 2
75 M to the 750,000 that are currently “Reaper-compatible” gives the number 3
The actual size of Reaper is probably limited to whatever size its authors want it to be
 Maybe Reaper is pure research
So far, Reaper hasn’t been seen attacking anyone with massive volumetric DDoS attacks
 If Reaper were to start being used as the ultimate Death Star weapon, that would cheapen its value
 Hajime was more polite and merely blocked ports and left a cute little note informing the device owner that their device was participating in attacks and please stahp!
If Reaper starts attacking people with DDoS, it will turn from a marvel of thingbot infrastructure engineering into (yawn) another volumetric attack tool
Right now, Reaper is an object lesson for IoT manufacturers and security researchers
We’ve been monitoring the Persirai botnet for the last six months
 We regularly measured Persirai at 750,000 IP cameras
 Persirai was never seen attacking anyone, either, and we speculated about what it could be doing
Reaper’s mission could be any one, or even several of those
Since Reaper is also composed of many digital video devices, we could speculate this: What if both Persirai and Reaper are actually surveillance networks? Think of the intel you could gather with access to millions of video cameras
 Just because Reaper is the latest, doesn't mean it will be the last
 If Reaper doesn’t attack anyone or give away its intentions, it may enter the same mythical space occupied by the Conficker worm of the 1990s
Stuxnet is a malicious computer worm, first uncovered in 2010
 Extremely sophisticated malware, which soon became known as “Stuxnet”, had deliberately targeted programmable logic controller (PLC) systems principally manufactured by Siemens
 However, in the case of Stuxnet, the malware had been designed for this precise scenario and was able to proliferate across the network using infected USB drives as an alternate vector
>See also: Ex-Army researcher links Conficker to Stuxnet
>See also: US and Israel built Flame as well as Stuxnet – report
 Some attacks, like Stuxnet, have a greater impact, but most malware found on ICS and SCADA systems don't appear to be from targeted attacks
 Cyber threats have been evolving ever since: from the Morris worm (1988), to Code Red (2001), to Slammer (2003), to Conficker (2008), to Stuxnet (2010), and beyond
 A simple analysis of Stuxnet reveals that one of the propagation methods used included the exploitation of the same vulnerabilities used by the Conficker worm that was identified and supposedly patched in 2008
 Stuxnet, for example, attempted to avoid discovery by bypassing host intrusion detection (using zero-day exploits that are not detectable by traditional IDS/ IPS prior to its discovery, and by using various autorun and network-based vectors), disguised itself as legitimate software (through the use of stolen digital certificates), and then covered its tracks by removing trace files from systems if they are no longer needed or if they are resident on systems that are incompatible with its payload
 As an extra precautionary measure, and to further elude the ability to detect the presence of the malware, Stuxnet would automatically remove itself from a host if it were not the intended target once it had infected other hosts a specific number of times
 By definition, Stuxnet and many other modern malware samples are considered "Advanced Persistent Threats" (APT)
 Stuxnet is, again, a useful example of weaponized malware
 Stuxnet utilized multiple zero-day exploits for infection
 Stuxnet raised a high degree of speculation about its source and its intent at least partly due to the level of resources required to deliver the worm through so many zero-days
 Stuxnet also used "insider intelligence" to focus on its target control system, which again implied that the creators of Stuxnet had significant resources and that they either had access to an industrial control system with which to develop and test their malware, or they had enough knowledge about how such a control system was built that they were able to develop it in a simulated environment
 The developers of Stuxnet could have used stolen intellectual property - which is the primary target of the APT - to develop a more weaponized piece of malware
 A great deal can be learned from Night Dragon and Stuxnet, as they both have components that specifically relate to industrial systems
 Although the attack did not result in sabotage, as was the case with Stuxnet, it did involve the theft of sensitive information, including operational oil and gas field production systems (including industrial control systems) and financial documents related to field exploration and bidding of oil and gas assets
Stuxnet Stuxnet is largely considered as a "game changer" in the industry, because it was the first targeted, weaponized cyber-attack against an industrial control system
 Prior to Stuxnet, it was still widely believed that industrial systems were either immune to cyber-attack (due to the obscurity and isolation of the systems), and were not being targeted by hackers or other cyber-threats
 Proof-of-concept cyber-attacks, such as the Aurora project, were met with skepticism prior to Stuxnet
 The "threat" pre-Stuxnet was largely considered to be limited to accidental infection of computing systems, or the result of an insider threat
 It is understandable, then, why Stuxnet was so widely publicized, and why it is still talked about today
 Stuxnet proved many assumptions of industrial cyber threats to be wrong, and did so using malware that was far more sophisticated than anything seen before
 Perhaps the most important lesson that Stuxnet taught us is that a cyber-attack is not limited to PCs and servers
 While Stuxnet used many methods to exploit and penetrate Windows-based systems, it also proved that malware could alter an automation process by infecting systems within the ICS, overwriting process logic inside a controller, and hiding its activity from monitoring systems
 Stuxnet is discussed in detail in Chapter 7, "Hacking Industrial Control Systems
