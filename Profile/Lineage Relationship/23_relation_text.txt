 Im Untersuchungszeitraum wurden dabei die Malware-Familien, wie Mirai, Bushido, Rift, Hakai, Gafgyt und Muhstik erkannt und gestoppt
According to Netlab, Muhstik is a variant of Tsunami, a malware strain that creates botnets with infected Linux servers and Linux-based IoT devices
 The most common malware families that target such devices are Mirai, Rift, Gafgyt, Bushido, Hakai and Muhstik
At the technical level, Netlab says Muhstik is built on top of Tsunami, a very old strain of malware that has been used for years to create botnets by infecting Linux servers and smart devices running Linux-based firmware
Crooks have used Tsunami initially for DDoS attacks, but its feature-set has greatly expanded after its source code leaked online
The Muhstik version of Tsunami, according to a Netlab report published today, can launch DDoS attacks, install the XMRig Monero miner, or install the CGMiner to mine Dash cryptocurrency on infected hosts
The five botnets are known under codenames such as Hajime, Mettle, Mirai, Muhstik, and Satori
 According to Netlab, the exploits of four botnets (Hajime, Mirai, Muhstik, and Satori) contain errors and are broken, preventing the botnets from bringing the routers under their control
TheMoon botnet behind new Dasan GPON zero-day
The botnet exploiting this new GPON router zero-day is called TheMoon, a very old threat that was first spotted in 2014 infecting Linux servers but has started switching to home routers IoT in recent years
TheMoon is only the latest botnet to add support for exploiting Dasan GPON routers
 Five botnets —Hajime, Mettle, Mirai, Muhstik, and Satori— have been exploiting two older exploits for almost a week
This might change in the upcoming days thanks to the new zero-day deployed by TheMoon botnet, but also because botnet operators have been working on improving their exploit payloads in the past days
