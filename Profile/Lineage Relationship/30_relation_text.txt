 For example, IoT_Reaper moved on from simply applying hard-coded passwords in the hope that they would unlock a system
 By contrast, the Hide N Seek malware, which builds on IoT_Reaper’s methods, prefers to install cryptominers, which generate virtual currency

 Among the others are those which target unsecured IoT devices, subverting them into what is called a botnet – the likes of Mirai, Satori, VPNFilter, and Slingshot
 The latter two have been linked to APT or nation state actors, Mirai and VPNFilter have been associated with distributed denial of service attacks, while Slingshot was reportedly used to pivot into internal networks
 Hasta hace unas semanas, ninguna cepa de malware IoT había sido capaz de sobrevivir a los reinicios de dispositivos, con el botnet Hide and Seek convirtiéndose en el primero a principios de este mes
 Angriffe, die mit IoT-Malware wie Mirai, IoTroop/Reaper und VPNFilter in Zusammenhang stehen, haben sich seit Mai 2018 mehr als verdoppelt
Das Reaper-Botnetz hat bereits über eine Millionen IoT-Geräte infiziert
Reaper rückt den IoT-Geräten dabei mit einem Arsenal an Hacking-Tools zu Leibe und versucht, Schwachstellen im Code ausfindig zu machen
Die Experten Qihoo 360 stellten fest, dass Reaper mehrere verschiedene Pakete im Repertoire hat, die auf Schwachstellen in Geräten von D-Link, Netgear, Linksys, AVTech, Vacron, JAWS und GoAhead sowie einigen Marken von Sicherheitskameras ausgerichtet sind
Laut den Sicherheitsexperten sind etwa 60 Prozent der Netzwerke mit der Reaper-Malware infiziert
 Beide Sicherheits-Unternehmen sagten aber, dass das Reaper-Botnet bislang noch nicht für schändliche Zwecke eingesetzt wurde

In April 2018, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) issued a joint statement warning of state-sponsored hackers leveraging vulnerabilities in routers, with the highly-publicized Slingshot and VPNFilter malware families discovered the same year
The same code was also famously used in Stuxnet, a worm which is believed to have damaged Iranian nuclear systems around 2010
Mirai’s successor was the Hajime ransomworm
 While Mirai was basically a blunt force instrument, Hajime included an impressive set of sophisticated cybertools
 Hajime, as well, was able to identify CPE devices and protocols and then remove the rules that allow a CPE device to talk to its service provider
Reaper changed the binary nature of most malware
Torii is the third IoT botnet, after VPNFilter and Hide and Seek, to gain persistence on the infected device
It is worth noting that although Torii shares some features with the Hide and Seek IoT botnet discovered in January by Bitdefender, the two are separate beasts
Marco Ramilli of Yoroi cybersecurity company analyzed the malware and noticed similarities to the Persirai worm that exploited weaknesses in the UPnP protocol to infect IP cameras in May last year

Similarly, the Slingshot malware was discovered to be dormant in routers for six years and is capable of information gathering, persistence, and data exfiltration
 Seculist researchers pointed out the similarities between Slingshot and the "Chimay Red" exploit published by WikiLeaks as part of the "Vault 7" releases of vulnerabilities, which WikiLeaks claims originated from the CIA
According to the report, IoT threats were rarely encountered before 2014, but that changed around the time of the release of the source code for Gafgyt – a threat that targeted a variety of IoT devices, including BusyBox devices, closed-circuit television (CCTV) devices and many digital video recorder (DVR) devices
In October 2016, Mirai, which was developed from Gafgyt’s code, became the first IoT malware to achieve global prominence when its botnet was used to launch one of the largest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in history that targeted domain name system (DNS) services provider Dyn
Malicious hackers are mass exploiting a critical vulnerability in D-Link DSL routers in an attempt to make them part of Satori, the potent Internet-of-things botnet that is used to take down websites and mine digital coins, researchers said
Since making its debut late last year, Satori has proven to be a particularly versatile and sophisticated botnet
 A month later, Satori operators released a new version that infected devices used to mine digital coins , proving that the IoT botnet could also take control of more traditional computing devices
 In February, Satori resurfaced when it infected tens of thousands of routers manufactured by Dasan Networks
A key to Satori’s success is its use of the publicly released Mirai IoT botnet source code to turn devices with easily guessable passwords into platforms for launching Internet-crippling attacks
 Satori operators use the Mirai code as a foundation on which they’ve erected an evolving series of new exploits that allow the botnet to control devices even when they’re secured with strong passwords
Over the past five days, researchers said, Satori has started mass exploiting a critical vulnerability in the D-Link DSL 2750B, a combination router and DSL modem that’s used by subscribers of Verizon and other ISPs
 Attack code exploiting the two-year-old remote code-execution vulnerability was published last month, although Satori’s customized payload delivers a worm
Researchers with Netlab 360 first reported Satori was exploiting the D-Link vulnerability in a blog post published Friday
 They also said Satori had started exploiting a vulnerability in a router made by XiongMai
 Dubbed VPNFilter, the malware isn’t believed to have any connection to Satori
 In May 2018, Bitdefender identified Hide and Seek, the first IoT botnet with device persistence, closely followed by Cisco’s discovery of VPNFilter – a piece of malware with more advanced survival capabilities
Video: Understanding the increase in cyberattacks against critical infrastructure From Stuxnet to Ukraine, hackers are ramping up attacks against infrastructure such as energy grids
The new IoT botnet variants reported by NOKIA in its monitored infrastructures in 2018, possibly malignant for CSP networks, include Mirai-based HideNSeek, DoubleDoor, VPNFilter – allegedly authored by Russian group “Fancy Bear” to destroy Linux/Busybox based routers and industrial control infrastructure, Torii responsible for telnet attacks from Tor exit nodes, Fbot that targets Android-operating IoT devices by scanning for an open port to get shell access over the infrastructure, and GhostDNS, which is used on home routers to steal banking credentials via fake banking servers
 The agent has been successful in stopping recent malware including DirtyCOW, Mirai, VPNFilter, Torii, and Chalubo
Wifatch malware that closed security holes on a variety of Linux-based routers
In 2017, a more devious vigilante hacker named The Janit0r deployed the BrickerBot malware that erased firmware or bricked IoT devices that had not been updated
