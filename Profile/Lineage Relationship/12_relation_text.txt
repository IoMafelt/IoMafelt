The Chalubo botnet, which incorporates malware such as Xor
 Over the past few weeks, Chalubo¡¯s creators have also turned to the Elknot dropper to release the full malware family, and the researchers noted that the bots can now run on a variety of other central processing unit (CPU) architectures, which could suggest that the botnet will become more pervasive in the near future
 The researchers noted that certain functions that allow the Xor
 However, apart from using these techniques, Chalubo also borrows code from Xor
The botnet is said to contain the main bot, a Lua command script, as well as the Elknot dropper

The main Chalubo bot is not only adopting obfuscation techniques more commonly found in Windows-based malware but is also using code from Xor
 The downloader is the Elknot dropper, which has previously been linked to the Elasticsearch botnet
A script is then dropped and executed for additional persistence, which Sophos says is close to a carbon copy of how the Xor
 Like some of its predecessors, Chalubo incorporates code from the Xor
 As of mid October, the attacker had been issuing commands that retrieve the Elknot dropper (detected as Linux/DDoS-AZ), which in turn delivers the rest of the Chalubo package
"Like some of its predecessors, Chalubo incorporates code from the Xor
Threat researcher Bart Blaze has described XOR - aka Linux/Xor
XOR, Xorddos - as being "a Linux Trojan with rootkit capabilities" that is akin to a Windows portable executable file
"Xor
 "The name Xor
 The anti-analysis techniques are principles more commonly used to thwart detection in Windows malware, though Chalubo does incorporate code from both the Xor DDoS and other Mirai malware families
 Since its detection, attackers have added commands that ¡°retrieve the Elknot dropper (detected as Linux/DDoS-AZ), which in turn delivers the rest of the Chalubo (ChaCha-Lua-bot) package,¡± according to Sophos News
 New variations of the Mirai and Gafgyt botnets exploit vulnerabilities found in IoT devices, including the security flaw that led to the massive Equifax breach of 2017
 The agent has been successful in stopping recent malware including DirtyCOW, Mirai, VPNFilter, Torii, and Chalubo
Researchers find Stuxnet, Mirai, WannaCry lurking in industrial USB drives
