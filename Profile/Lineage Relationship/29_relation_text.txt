Researchers observed a family of bots dubbed Chalubo launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to conduct brute-force entry against Linux-based systems running internet-facing SSH servers
The Chalubo botnet, which incorporates malware such as Xor
 Chalubo’s components include a downloader, a Lua command script and the main bot, which was optimized for hardware running Intel x86 processors
 Over the past few weeks, Chalubo’s creators have also turned to the Elknot dropper to release the full malware family, and the researchers noted that the bots can now run on a variety of other central processing unit (CPU) architectures, which could suggest that the botnet will become more pervasive in the near future
Chalubo Steals Threat Tactics From Other Malware
DDoS family to achieve persistence were copied in the Chalubo code, for example
 Similarly, code from Mirai had been copied to the main Chalubo bot
Denial-of-service attacks can cripple website performance and bring other areas of enterprise IT to a grinding halt, so if Chalubo was found via a honeypot, its creators are likely aiming for real targets, too
A new report issued by researchers from a cybersecurity company called SophosLabs claims that a new botnet called Chalubo (ChaCha-Lua-bot) is targeting badly secured SSH servers
Upon infecting devices, Chalubo downloads malware that uses them for launching DDoS attacks
 However, apart from using these techniques, Chalubo also borrows code from Xor
The botnet is said to contain the main bot, a Lua command script, as well as the Elknot dropper
 According to their report, this might indicate that the testing period is over and that Chalubo is ready to be used in large-scale attacks
Chalubo attacks started in August, but it was only the attack on September 6th that has provided researchers with enough insight into the botnet’s capabilities
 Malware in Lua is something we have seen before with Linux/Shishiga
Since early September, SophosLabs has been monitoring an increasingly prolific attack targeting Internet-facing SSH servers on Linux-based systems that has been dropping a newly-discovered family of denial-of-service bots we’re calling Chalubo
 Like some of its predecessors, Chalubo incorporates code from the Xor
When Chalubo downloaders started circulating in late August, the attacker issued commands on the victim’s device to retrieve the malware, which was actually comprised of three components: A downloader; the main bot (which ran only on systems with an x86 processor architecture); and the Lua command script
 As of mid October, the attacker has been issuing commands that retrieve the Elknot dropper (detected as Linux/DDoS-AZ), which in turn delivers the rest of the Chalubo (ChaCha-Lua-bot) package
SophosLabs first discovered the Chalubo family from an attack on one of our honeypots, which we use to collect data on malicious activity
As an aside, at the end of September the same attacker’s machine attacked our honeypots again, but attempted to retrieve the BillGates malware family [Linux/DDoS-BD] that some have attributed to the Elknot authors
 In fact, looking closely at the code responsible for all of the persistence portions here, it appears that Chalubo has copied the DelService & AddService functions from the Xor
 It’s clear that the author of Chalubo had access to the source of the Xor
Chalubo uses the stream cipher ChaCha, set to 20 rounds
The ChaCha-IETF implementation within Chalubo treats the 4 byte counter as a separate argument
Chalubo initial key state expa nd␣3 2-by te␣k Key Key Key Key Key Key Key Key Arg Nonce Nonce Nonce
The Chalubo implementation initializes the counter to start from one(1) instead of zero
 Some others, such as the crypto API within the Linux kernel, treat the last 16 bytes of counter and nonce as a single input argument, however the Libsodium library has the ChaCha-IETF implementation with a counter as a separate argument — and even then, the order of the arguments doesn’t quite line up with what we see in Chalubo
And this is the same function in Chalubo (if we renamed some of the variables to match those in the example above):
So we can certainly say the Chalubo ChaCha function is a unique implementation whose algorithm matches the peer/IETF recommendations
It became clear, once we looked at the bot, that Chalubo had copied a few code snippets from Mirai, such as some of the randomizing functions and what appears to be an extended form of the util_local_addr function
Sophos endpoint and server protection detects this family as Linux/Chalubo-*
Elknot dropper
Chalubo is a new botnet which is targeting poorly-secured Internet of Things (IoT) devices and servers for the purpose of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
The main Chalubo bot is not only adopting obfuscation techniques more commonly found in Windows-based malware but is also using code from Xor
Chalubo contains a downloader, the main bot -- which runs on systems with an x86 processor architecture, and a Lua command script
 The downloader is the Elknot dropper, which has previously been linked to the Elasticsearch botnet
Chalubo attempted to brute-force attack and secure the credentials of the honeypot, and while the attackers believed they were able to gain a shell through root admin, the researchers silently recorded how they used commands to 'stop' firewall protections and install malicious components
 However, Chalubo is far from the only botnet menace out there
The new botnet has been dubbed Chalubo by Sophos because it encrypts both the main bot component and its corresponding Lua script using the ChaCha stream cipher
 Like some of its predecessors, Chalubo incorporates code from the Xor
When Chalubo downloaders started circulating in late August, the attacker issued commands on the victim’s device to retrieve the malware
 As of mid October, the attacker had been issuing commands that retrieve the Elknot dropper (detected as Linux/DDoS-AZ), which in turn delivers the rest of the Chalubo package
There are now a variety of Chalubo versions that run on different processor architectures, including both 32- and 64-bit ARM, x86, x86_64, MIPS, MIPSEL, and PowerPC
Because Chalubo infects systems by leveraging common username and password combinations against SSH servers, Sophos urges sysadmins of SSH servers (including embedded devices) change any default passwords on those devices, because the brute force attempts to cycle through common, publicly known default passwords
Chalubo Botnet Borrows From Mirai
 For example, security firm Sophos reports that since August, it's seen an attack that's designed to gain brute-force access to SSH servers - including on IoT devices - that it's dubbed Chalubo

Chalubo's XOR-derived DDoS attack capabilities come in "DNS, UDP and SYN flavors," Easton at Sophos says
Recent research into old malware threats associated with the Stuxnet attacks against Iran’s nuclear program roughly one decade ago turned up several new discoveries, including a possible fourth collaborator in the clandestine operation, as well as previously unknown versions of Flame and Duqu malware
the modular cyber espionage malware known as Flame and a group of nation-state actors presumed to be involved in the Stuxnet malware attack
The Stuxnet attackers, which Chronicle collectively calls “GOSSIPGIRL,” is widely understood to include the developers of Flame and Duqu, and the Equation Group
But based on Chronicle’s findings, a fourth group looks to have been involved in Stuxnet’s development
 The malware’s code can be found within a particular Stuxnet component called Stuxshop, and was used to communicate with C2 servers, among other functionality,
“The value of this recent finding is twofold: First, it suggests that yet another team with its own malware platform was involved in the early development of Stuxnet
 And secondly, it supports the view that Stuxnet is in fact the product of a modular development framework meant to enable collaboration among diverse, independent threat actors,” Guerrero-Saade and Cutler state in a technical report
 “Our recent findings, alongside the outstanding body of previously reported technical analysis on this threat, would place the ‘Flowershop team’ alongside Equation, Flame, and Duqu as those involved in tooling the different phases of Stuxnet as an operation active perhaps as early as 2006
During the course of their study, the researchers also found a previously unknown version of Duqu, a malware built from Stuxnet that’s designed to steal information useful toward attacking industrial control systems
 The family, dubbed Chalubo, has been used in attacks targeting internet-facing SSH servers on Linux-based systems, according to SophosLabs
 The anti-analysis techniques are principles more commonly used to thwart detection in Windows malware, though Chalubo does incorporate code from both the Xor DDoS and other Mirai malware families
The Chalubo family attacked a SophosLabs honeypot on September 6, 2018, at which time researchers noted the bot attempting to brute-force login credentials against an SSH server
 Since its detection, attackers have added commands that “retrieve the Elknot dropper (detected as Linux/DDoS-AZ), which in turn delivers the rest of the Chalubo (ChaCha-Lua-bot) package,” according to Sophos News

Previously, during September, Unit 42 also spotted a strain of the Mirai botnet switching targets to attack Apache Struts servers with exploits also utilized during last year's Equifax breach, while a new Gafgyt version was seen assailing SonicWall firewalls, as part of a broader move against enterprise devices
Thanks to the Cyber Threat Alliance, SophosLabs researchers were provided early access to malware samples collected by Cisco TALOS team in their research of the VPNFilter botnet activity
VPNFilter malware is another clear demonstration of rather philosophical paradigm: the more IoT devices we have helping us out in our daily lives, the more advanced the CPUs become, driving our routers, cars, or refrigerators (you name it), the bigger an attack surface becomes
VPNFilter also demonstrates how the cybercriminals achieve a high degree of portability by building their code so that it targets different architectures
VPNFilter isn’t the first zombie malware to target everyday devices on everyone’s network, and it won’t be the last
