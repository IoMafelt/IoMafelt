Satori
 Further investigation by the research team uncovered a new variant of the Satori botnet capable of aggressive scanning and exploitation of CVE-2017-18046 〞 Dasan Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution

The rapidly growing botnet referred to as ※Satori
Hajime Expands to MikroTik RouterOS
Satori IoT Botnet Worm Variant
 The previously unseen payload was delivered by the infamous Satori botnet
For example, JenX uses two exploits previously used by the Satori botnet to break into devices and ensnare them into its grasp
In addition, JenX also borrowed some techniques from the PureMasuta botnet source code, recently posted online and detailed in this NewSky Security report
Both Satori and PureMasuta are variants of the Mirai IoT malware leaked online in late 2016, but despite this, JenX has its unique parts as well
 This exploit vector was publicly disclosed in April 2015, tracing back to several high profile IoT botnets like Satori and JenX, both of which can be traced back to an old ＆friend＊ 每 Mirai 每 proving that the shelf life for an IoT-based exploit can last for years
But where the BrickerBot author crafted his botnet to seek out and permanently disable vulnerable devices in order to protect the internet from would be wrongdoers, JenX appears to be designed solely for profit
While JenX has grown, it is unlikely that it can reach the same massive scale that its Mirari and Satori predecessors achieved
 When the Mirai and Satori botnets infected a device, each of those new controlled bots would scan for more insecure devices themselves
Researchers at Radware have discovered a new botnet that uses vulnerabilities linked with the Satori botnet and is leveraging the Grand Theft Auto videogame community to infect IoT devices
Satori is a derivative of Mirai, the notorious botnet that in 2016 infamously managed to take down Dyn, a DNS hosting provider that supports some of the world＊s largest websites
 ※Nearly all botnets, including Mirai, Hajime, Persirai, Reaper, Satori and Masuta perform distributed scanning and exploiting
In 2017, researchers identified a new IoT botnet, named IoT Reaper or IoTroop, that built on portions of Mirai's code
 Specifically, researchers have identified the following four Mirai variants: Satori Botnet, Masuta Botnet, Wicked Mirai, and JenX botnet, each of which is described in further detail below
Satori Botnet
The Satori Botnet is a variant of Mirai that targets software associated with ARC processors, which are used in a variety of IoT devices
 Once it finds a vulnerable IoT device, Satori performs a check to determine whether the device's default settings have been changed, and, if not, uses these default credentials to gain control of the device
Most recently, researchers have identified that Satori-controlled devices were mass-scanning the Internet for cryptocurrency-mining devices that were exposed to the internet
Masuta
Masuta comes in two variants, Masuta Botnet, which uses the same techniques as Mirai by attempting to overcome the security of the target IoT devices using a built-in list of common passwords and default credentials, and PureMasuta, which has been described as "an enhanced version" with a built-in exploit against certain vulnerable routers
 Masuta is believed to be the work of the same group responsible for developing the Satori Botnet, however unlike Satori, Masuta attacks allow the actors to take direct control of compromised devices, making other malicious actions possible, including:
Wicked Mirai
The Wicked iteration of Mirai contains a package that includes at least three exploits
 Unlike Mirai, however, which used brute force to gain access to vulnerable IoT devices, the Wicked version relies on a variety of port-related vulnerability exploits, some new and some very old, to gain access to a device
Once on a system, Wicked Mirai contacts a command and control server from which it downloads a payload (in some cases payloads from other Mirai variants like Sora, Owari, and Omni) that can vary based on the attackers' objective and the nature of the affected device
 Wicked looks for specific vulnerabilities on a platform that the botnet can exploit
 In addition, the Wicked variant is also able to maintain a presence on IoT devices it infects beyond the occasional reboots, increasing its power and persistence to launch substantial DDoS attacks
 Unlike the Satori and Masuta variants, JenX has a centralized infrastructure and uses a central server to perform the scanning of new hosts
 Both vulnerabilities are also exploited by a different Internet-of-things botnet known as Satori
By contrast, Mirai, Satori, Reaper, and other IoT botnets rely on infected devices to locate and infect vulnerable devices
JenX, Satori, Reaper, and other second-generation IoT botnets have gotten around this limitation by exploiting firmware vulnerabilities in Internet-connected devices
The potential for this botnet is comparable to Satori as it uses the exact same exploits
 However, the growth rate of this bot will not be as high as Satori because Satori is using bots that each scan and exploit by themselves〞so more bots, more scanners, more victims, even more bots, even more scanners, etc＃
 so exponential growth rate for the Mirai, Satori and Reaper botnets
 By adding more servers they can make it grow faster, but never will be as efficient and aggressive as Mirai, Satori and Reaper
, Satori, JenX, etc
 The work looks at four Mirai variants 每 Satori, JenX, OMG and Wicked 每 to illustrate how their authors have built upon Mirai and added their own flair:
Satori leveraged remote code injection exploits to enhance the Mirai code
OMG adds a novel feature in the form of an HTTP and SOCKS proxy
Wicked can target Netgear routers and CCTV-DVR devices that happen to be vulnerable to remote code execution flaws
 Within the exploit, Wicked includes instructions to download and execute a copy of the Owari bot
 Pascal discovered the BrickerBot, JenX and Demonbot botnets, did extensive research on Hajime, the Hadoop YARN attack surface, and follows closely new developments and threats in the IoT space as well as applications of AI in cyber security and hacking
CVE-2014-8361, for example, was first publicly disclosed in April 2015 and has been used in a number of IoT botnets including the high profile Satori and JenX
 The most popular attack over the past four months came from an exploit that was publicly known about back in April 2015, and is connected to attacks from the Satori and JenX botnets, the company said on its blog
Satori , che scaturisce dalle capacit角 di iniezione di codice da remoto sfruttando la scansione di Mirai
 Il bot OMG , che 豕 una new entry sulla scena dei malware dell＊IoT, e che fa leva sul codice sorgente di Mirai per ampliarlo, conseguendo cos足 capacit角 proxy HTTP e SOCKS
 Wicked, che 豕 il pi迄 recente pupillo di Mirai, e che si introduce invece nelle falle RCE per infettare router Netgear e dispositivi CCTV-DVR
 Satori - same, some of the code there, as well
