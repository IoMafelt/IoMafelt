New Mirai malware called OMG can turn any IoT device into the proxy server
The new version of Mirai malware[1] has a short and vivid name C OMG
It seems that the main purpose of the OMG malware is to sell access to hacked IoT devices to cyber criminals
Mirai OMG malware is not the first modification of the virus
In 2017, researchers reported about Satori[4] C version of Mirai botnet that exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Huawei routers
 The Masuta (or PureMasuta) version of Mira was exploiting D-Link router’s vulnerabilities
 The recent discovery of OMG Mirai botnet allows assuming that similar attacks will continue in the future
It’s true that Mirai, and variants such as Okiru and Satori, pose a major risk to manufacturing, where the reduction of a connected device’s processing power can seriously impact safety or disrupt processes
The prospect of motivated attackers leveraging destructive malware such as BrickerBot to wipe devices is highly concerning, but such ‘attacks’ need not even be targeted to cause damage
Mirai Vs OMG
OMG usando 3Proxy
Empezaremos hablando de la tabla de configuración de OMG
 Lo que se identificó primero, fue la cadena /bin/busybox OOMGA and OOMGA: applet not found
 Estos string son similares con otras variantes como Satori/Okiru, Masuta
Por esa razón Fortiguard, decidió llamar a esa variante OMG
Se puede observar como OMG guarda los módulos originales, incluyendo modulo de ataque, eliminación y SCAN
Después de iniciar el modulo, OMG procede a conectarse a un C&C (Comando y control) server
Cuando Conecta, OMG envía un mensaje definido (0X00000000) al C&C para identificarse como nuevo Bot ( una especie de registro)Basado en el código recibe un string de 5 byte de largo, con el primer usado para determinar como va a ser usado el BOT
以前，雷锋网宅客频道（微信ID：letshome）给大家科普过，自从美国东部大断网后，规模更大的僵尸网络层出不穷。其中，规模大到吓人的一个是 Mirai 僵尸网络的一个变种，叫做 Satori，还有人又把这个 Satori 叫做 Okiru。
八卦一下，Satori 是日本禅宗用语，Okiru 也是一个日语发音，安全研究员们因此有个小小的猜想，这个僵尸网络的作者可能是个日本文化的痴迷者。
言归正传，本来安全研究员正在监测 Satori 的进展，因为 Satori 规模实在很大，大家对它的一举一动很关心，生怕沉寂的僵尸网络一下变得活跃，那么下一场大断网就不知道发生在哪里了。
大家很担心，于是各方联合绞杀，封堵 Satori 利用的网络端口。眼看着，Satori 感染的路由器速度降了下来，各方倍感欣慰。
不料，李丰沛等人最近突然发现：咦，Satori 这货最近要搞事啊！原来，他们监测到了一个 Satori 的变种：Satori
当然，你要说了，你凭什么说这个变种就是 Satori 的变种？
“一般这个证据就已经很强了，再加上其他的辅助的证据，我们认为，这次的 Satori
Robber 和我们上次报告的 Satori 应该是同一个人或者同一伙人做的。”李对雷锋网说。
李丰沛等人发表了该变种的报告后，在推特上转发了这次报告的内容。不料，这个报告里有一个邮件地址，这个邮件地址被 Satori
Satori dev here, dont be alarmed about this bot it does not currently have any malicious packeting purposes move along
Okiru malware is different from Mirai and from Mirai variant Satori because it uses its own unique configurations and botnet command-and-control servers, and it uses different exploits to gain control of victim systems
You may remember hearing about the Mirai malware variant Satori (pdf) back in December; it was sometimes also called Okiru
 Satori was used to attack “hundreds of thousands” of Huawei routers
Despite the similarities of the two type of Linux IoT DDoS malware, Mirai Okiru is “very different” from the Mirai Satori variant
The MMD researchers who have already proceeded to release the Yara rules to identify this new variant of Mirai, have compared Okiru with the previous Mirai botnet called Satori
Very important to understand how #Mirai #Satori variant is DIFFERENT from #Okiru: quick notes with screenshots by @malwaremustdie
A variant of the Satori botnet, a successor of the IoT device hijacking Mirai botnet, is designed to hijack cryptocurrency mining operations, syphoning off newly created digital coins Read Now
's Unit 42 found new variants of the Gafgyt and Mirai botnets targeting unpatched enterprise devices with an assortment of vulnerabilities, including the Apache Struts bug that was exploited in the Equifax breach
The Gafgyt and Mirai botnets received updates enabling them to exploit vulnerabilities in Apache Struts and in SonicWall's Global Management System
 Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 found new variants of the Gafgyt and Mirai botnets that are able to scan for vulnerable systems
Today, IoT botnet families, including Mirai, Okiru, the Satori, the Masuta, the PureMasuta and Reaper, continue mutating
A 20-year-old from Vancouver, Washington was indicted last week on federal hacking charges and for allegedly operating the “Satori” botnet, a malware strain unleashed last year that infected hundreds of thousands of wireless routers and other “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices
 But according to Poulsen, the charges are related to Schuchman’s alleged authorship and use of the Satori botnet
 Satori, also known as “Masuta,” is a variant of the Mirai botnet, a powerful IoT malware strain that first came online in July 2016
Schuchman reportedly went by the handle “Nexus Zeta,” the nickname used by a fairly inexperienced and clumsy ne’er-do-well who has tried on multiple occasions to get KrebsOnSecurity to write about the Satori botnet
In each case, this person wanted to talk about a new IoT botnet that he was “researching” and that he thought deserved special attention for its size and potential disruptive impact should it be used in a massive Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack aimed at knocking a Web site offline ― something for which Satori would soon become known
For weeks after that tweet, Nexus Zeta exchanged private twitter messages with Mursch and his team of botnet hunters at Bad Packets LLC in a bid to get them to Tweet or write about Satori/Masuta
The following screenshots from their private Twitter discussions, republished with Mursch’s permission, showed that Nexus Zeta kept up the fiction about his merely “researching” the activities of Satori
 Mursch played along, and asked gently probing questions about the size, makeup and activities of a rapidly growing Satori botnet
Early in their conversations, Nexus Zeta says he is merely following the visible daily Internet scanning that Satori generated in a constant search for newly infectable IoT devices
 But as their conversations continue over several weeks, Nexus Zeta intimates that he has much deeper access to Satori
 5, Chinese cybersecurity firm Netlab360 released a report on Satori noting that the IoT malware was spreading rapidly to Chinese-made Huawei routers with the help of two security vulnerabilities, including one “zero day” flaw that was unknown to researchers at the time
 29, 2017 titled “Good Zero Day Kiddie,” researchers at Israeli security firm CheckPoint pointed out that the domain name used as a control server to synchronize the activities of the Satori botnet ― nexusiotsolutions-dot-net ― was registered in 2016 to the email address nexuszeta1337@gmail

Last month hackers released the code for a separate Mirai variant known as Satori, which was used to exploit a zero-day vulnerability in a Huawei router model, infecting more than 280,000 devices in 12 hours
Researchers have discovered new variants for the infamous Mirai and Gafgyt IoT botnets C now targeting well-known vulnerabilities in Apache Struts and SonicWall
The new Mirai strain targets the Apache Struts flaw associated with the 2017 Equifax breach, while the Gafgyt variant uses a newly-disclosed glitch impacting older, unsupported versions of SonicWall’s Global Management System, according to researchers with Palo Alto Networks in a Sunday post
“Here we’re seeing Mirai and Gafgyt variants targeting systems mostly seen in enterprises,” Ruchna Nigam, researcher with Palo Alto Networks, told Threatpost
Unit 42 also found that the domain currently hosting these Mirai samples previously resolved to a different IP address during the month of August ― an IP address hosting a new version of Gafgyt as well
Gafgyt Adds to Bag of Tricks
In August, the observed IP was “intermittently hosting samples of Gafgyt that incorporated an exploit against CVE-2018-9866, a SonicWall vulnerability affecting older versions of SonicWall Global Management System (GMS),” according to Nigam
SonicWall has been notified of this latest development with Gafgyt, researchers said
The Gafgyt botnet exploits a range of IoT flaws, including other issues in Huawei, GPON and D-Link devices
“One thing that stood out was the Gafgyt variant having support for the BlackNurse DDoS attack method,” Ruchna told us
The discovery of new targeted vuln comes after it was revealed in July that Mirai and Gafgyt were actively launching two IoT/Linux botnet campaigns, exploiting the CVE-2018-10562 and CVE-2018-10561 bugs in Dasan routers
Most recently, in April, a variant of the Mirai botnet was used to launch a series of DDoS campaigns against financial sector businesses, while in January, researchers identified a variant called Satori (Mirai Okiru)
Researchers have identified a vulnerability in a Huawei home router model that is being exploited by an adversary to spread a variant of the Mirai malware called Mirai Okiru, also known as Satori
Researchers have identified a vulnerability in a Huawei home router model that is being exploited by an adversary to spread a variant of the Mirai malware called Mirai Okiru, also known as Satori
Okiku/Satori was first identified by Check Point researchers on November 23
In the case of Mirai Okiru/Satori, Check Point researchers suspected an inexperienced hacker that goes by “Nexus Zeta” is behind the attacks
The Mirai Okiru/Satori attacks differs from previous Mirai variants in that they don’t rely on brute-force telnet-based attacks
The router malware started spreading in November and has been dubbed Satori or Okiru by security companies
 However, Satori also incorporated exploits into its scans, particularly for a known remote command execution vulnerability in the Miniigd UPnP SOAP service running on some devices on port 52869 and a previously unknown vulnerability for a service running on port 37215
 However, researchers from Check Point believe Satori’s creator is an amateur hacker using the online alias Nexus Zeta
Exploit code used in the Mirai malware variant called Satori, which was used to attack hundreds of thousands of Huawei routers over the past several weeks, is now public
 Researchers warn the code will quickly become a commodity and be leveraged in DDoS attacks via botnets such as Reaper or IOTrooper
 The code is the zero-day vulnerability CVE- 2017-17215 used by a hacker identified as “Nexus Zeta” to spread a variant of the Mirai malware called Satori, also known as Mirai Okiru
Last week, Check Point identified the vulnerability (CVE-2017-17215) in a Huawei home router model HG532 that was being exploited by Nexus Zeta to spread the Mirai variant Mirai Okiru/Satori
“The exploit code was already used by two major IoT botnets, Brickerbot and Satori, and now that the code is public it will be incorporated into different botnet strains,” Anubhav said
Researchers said a Mirai botnet variant, possibly linked to the IoTroop or Reaper botnet, was leveraged in attacks against the financial sector
 They said the Mirai botnet and malware variant also exhibited characteristics that may link it to IoTroop botnet (or Reaper), first identified October 2017
“If these attacks were conducted by IoTroop, then our observations indicate the botnet has evolved since October 2017 to exploit vulnerabilities in additional IoT devices and is likely to continue to do so to propagate the botnet and facilitate larger DDoS attacks,” wrote Priscilla Moriuchi and Sanil Chohan, who co-authored the report
IoTroop shares some of Mirai’s code, according to a previous analysis of the malware
Recorded Future noted this latest variant of Mirai differs from the original Mirai and IoTroop malware
 Mirai and IoTroop are names for both the botnet and the malware used to infect the IoT devices
“While many of the IoT vendors and devices appeared in the (IoTroop) research published in October 2017, many of the devices such as Dahua CCTV DVRs, Samsung UE55D7000 TVs and Contiki-based devices were previously unknown to be vulnerable to Reaper/IoTroop malware,” researchers said
Making this latest unnamed Mirai variant even more potent is the use of IoTroop code that allows the malware to be updated on the fly
 “[IoTroop] was built using a flexible Lua engine and scripts, which means that instead of being limited to the static, pre-programmed attacks of previous exploits, its code can be easily updated on the fly, allowing massive in-place botnets to run new and more malicious attacks as soon as they become available,” researchers said
“As more data comes to light on the continued targeting of financial institutions from IoTroop, it will become increasingly important to monitor the potential controllers and identify new IoT devices being added to the botnet in preparation for further attacks,” researchers said
 In January, researchers identified a variant called Satori (Mirai Okiru) The available Mirai source code has also given new life to the DDoS as a service industry, since the Mirai code isn’t easily converted into a profit-making machine without some previous expertise
New Mirai variant named Mirai OMG
Fortinet has named this variant Mirai OMG ―based on the OOMGA string found in some parts of the malware's source code where the term "Mirai" used to be― and this variant now joins a growing Mirai family that also includes variants such as Satori (Okiru), Masuta, and Akuma
But while Fortinet has not analyzed the traffic flowing through the Mirai OMG network, in theory, it should not be any different from the regular type of traffic that malicious proxy networks have been relaying for years
Since Mirai OMG still relies on the classic Mirai spreading technique of brute-forcing devices using weak passwords, changing any IoT equipment's default password should safeguard most users from having their device taken over for a crime spree
Satori Botnet's Alleged Developer Rearrested
The alleged author of a supercharged variant of Mirai malware called Satori has been rearrested for violating his bail conditions
 30 that authorities accused Schuchman of being "Nexus Zeta," the hacker handle of the individual who claims to have built the virulent Mirai-derived Satori botnet
The Rise of Satori
In November 2017, researchers at the security firm Check Point Software Technologies identified a new botnet, based on Mirai, known both as Satori and Okiru
 Check Point tied Satori to infections of at least 260,000 internet-connected devices in just its first 12 hours of life
 It said the vulnerability had been exploited by Satori as well as earlier that month by another strain of malware called Brickerbot - built by someone using the handle "Janitor" - which was designed to target internet of things devices
Satori Modified to Target Cryptocurrency
While Satori initially continued Mirai's focus on using infected endpoints to launch massive distributed denial-of-service attacks, by January, new versions included the ability to target Claymore cryptocurrency mining software, giving the attacker the ability to make infected systems mine for Ethereum cryptocurrency, according to researchers at China-based Netlab 360
"Once a Claymore mining machine was found, it hijacked the miner's wallet address to point to the Satori operator's wallet by modifying the miner configuration file, thus stealing the mined currency that the rig produces," say researchers at the Threat Research Labs at U
Satori Reawakened in September
In what may be a coincidence, CenturyLink Threat Research Labs has been tracking a pool of devices infected with Satori, and it says the botnet went dormant following Schuchman's arrest, only to be reawakened later
To be clear: It's not clear who operates the Satori botnet
 But CenturyLink notes that some Satori bots scan for TCP port 5555 in an attempt to infect Android devices that have Android Debug Bridge enabled via that port
In late August, CenturyLink says it was monitoring a Satori command-and-control - aka C2 - server that was scanning for ADB on port 5555, and it found that connections from bots to the C2 server suddenly declined
 "This was just days after the news broke that the actor rumored to be responsible for the Satori botnet was indicted
Today Mirai variants continue to expand into new turf, including Mirari Okiru, which targets ARC processors (the chips embedded in cars, mobile devices, smart TVs, surveillance cameras and many more connected products) and Mirai Satori, which hijacks crypto currency mining operations,
A so-called "script kiddie" is behind the recently discovered Satori botnet that has scared security researchers because of its rapid rise to a size of hundreds of thousands of compromised devices
Researchers say that a hacker named Nexus Zeta created Satori, which is a variant of the Mirai IoT malware that was released online in October 2016
Satori botnet used Huawei zero-day
Satori, which is also tracked under the name of Mirai Okiru, came to life around November 23, when the malware started spreading on the Internet
Satori was extremely virulent, infecting many devices from the get-go
Bleeping Computer reported about Satori on December 5, when the botnet started popping up on the honeypots of various security researchers and cyber-security firms
Satori botnet C&C servers taken down
Over the past weekend, representatives from numerous ISPs and cyber-security firms intervened and took down the main Satori botnet C&C servers, according to industry insiders who spoke with Bleeping Computer
 The most likely scenario is that Nexus Zeta is looking to scan and find bots for another Satori instance
Script kiddie behind Satori
In a report published yesterday, Check Point researchers revealed the identity of the Satori botnet author ―the aforementioned Nexus Zeta
Researchers say they've tracked him down because he registered domains used in the Satori infrastructure with an email address that was also used for a HackForums account ―infamous meeting place for wannabe hackers
A forum post made on November 22, a day before Satori activity started to be detected, show Nexus Zeta asking for help in setting up a Mirai botnet (Satori is a Mirai variant)
 The first is "Will Satori make a comeback?" and the second is "Did Nexus Beta discover the complex Huawei zero-day on his own, or did he buy it from somewhere else?
Based on information Bleeping Computer obtained, Satori was not identified as the source of any major DDoS attack in the past few weeks
The Satori (Mirai Okiru) botnet should not be confused with another Mirai botnet that came to life last month, which is based on the Mirai Akuma variant
 If you're looking for IOCs and an analysis of the Satori malware's inner-workings, we recommend reading the reports
Meanwhile, the Mirai source code has been adapted to create new strains of malware, including Satori/Okiru, designed to infect many more types of internet-connected devices and use them as launch pads for DDoS and other types of cybercrime attacks (see: Botnets Keep Brute-Forcing Internet of Things Devices)
 According to FortiGuard Labs researchers, the botnet dubbed "OMG" is based on the OOMGA string found in some parts of the malware's source code where the name "Mirai" used to appear
The latest OMG joins the growing Mirai family filled with variants such as Satori, Okiru, Masuta and more
Mirai OMG adds and removes some configurations that were found in the original Mirai code, but still includes the original modules including the attack, killer and scanner modules
Therefore, OMG can perform several functions that the original Mirai could such as killing processes, brute-forcing devices with weak passwords to spread and carrying out DoS attacks
The rise of the Satori botnet and the fall of the Andromeda (Gamarue) botnet are the main two factors that have led to a 50% growth of the Spamhaus Exploits Block List (XBL) during the past month
Satori and IoT botnets
Of these, the botnet identified as Satori (also known as the Mirai Okiru variant) contributed by far the most to the XBL
While ProxyM and some other Mirai IoT botnets have also been quite active in recent months, they pale in comparison to the size of Satori, which just yesterday began another massive scan campaign to look for new victims, according to experts from LloydsLabs and Qihoo 360 Netlab who spoke with your reporter
Overall, while Satori appears to be the main threat at the time of writing, Spamhaus highlights the danger of IoT botnets in a tell-tale statistic from the past year
Embora os criadores originais da rede de bots Mirai já tenham sido presos, variantes do infame malware IoT, incluindo Satori e Okiru , continuam surgindo devido à disponibilidade de seu código-fonte na Internet desde 2016
The hacker behind the Satori botnet, also known as Mirai Okiru, is involved in the creation of a new Mirai variant called Masuta, which means "master" in Japanese
 The creator of Satori, who goes by the name Nexus Zeta, has also developed a variant of the Masuta botnet called PureMasuta
Researchers at NewSky Security were able to get their hands on Masuta's source code in an invite-only dark web forum, which led them to uncover the link between Satori and Masuta
 In December, Nexus Zeta was found exploiting a zero-day flaw in Huawei routers to escalate Satori attacks
 Earlier this month, the malware code for the Satori botnet was also released on Pastebin for free
According to NewSky Security researchers, since September 2017, Masuta attacks have soared twelve-fold
 The researchers found that both Masuta and PureMasuta share the same server, hinting that PureMasuta may be a more recent and evolved version of Masuta
They also believe that the proof of concept of the weaponised exploit used by PureMasuta could be leveraged in attacks by other hackers as it is publicly available
According to the researchers, although Nexus Zeta was previously not considered as a very advanced hacker, his/her involvement in the creation of the Masuta botnet variants suggests that he/she may be more skilled than previously thought
"Nexus Zeta is not a one-hit wonder creator of Satori, but also has been involved in the creation of the Masuta botnet," NewSky Security researcher Ankit Anubhav said in a report
 Early reports of a new botnet variant, named 'Masuta', show how the initial Mirai simple password brute-force methods, which are still employed, are now being supplemented with more sophisticated vulnerability exploits," Sean Newman, Director of Product Management at Corero Network Security, told IBTimes UK
 Over the years, various individuals have been alleged to have utilized the LizardStresser DDoS service offered by Lizard Squad, and have ended up getting arrested
Satori, Memes and Masuta, two of the many variants of Mirai malware, were also linked to this group and the Satori campaign that was originally titled Okiru was hosted from numerous domains one of which happened to be network[
]ru during the November 2017 Satori campaign to launch Monero Stratum miner also showed evidence of a link between Lizard Squad and Mirai
 "The bot can perform web exploitation against a series of devices via the same exploit as Reaper (CVE-2016-10401 and other vulnerabilities against networking equipment)
"It is the second known IoT botnet to date, after the notorious Hajime botnet, that has a decentralized, peer-to-peer architecture," Bitdefender wrote
 "However, if in the case of Hajime, the p2p functionality was based on the BitTorrent protocol, here we have a custom-built p2p communication mechanism
"While IoT botnets have been around for years, mainly used for DDoS attacks, the discoveries made during the investigation of the Hide and Seek bot reveal greater levels of complexity and novel capabilities such as information theft C potentially suitable for espionage or extortion," they wrote
 Di solito, i recenti malware mirano a trasformare i computer in minatori di criptomonete per conto terzi, ma la variante del virus “Satori”, scovata dai cinesi di “Netlab 360”, è differente e, dopo aver compromesso il software per la generazione di Ethereum (1400 dollari ad unità, al cambio) “Claymore Mining”, attraverso la porta 3333 (lasciata scoperta nelle impostazioni di default), indirizza le monete virtuali generate verso il portafoglio (wallet) dei criminali
