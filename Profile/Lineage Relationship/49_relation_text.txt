While for many years the GafGyt malware strain dominated the IoT malware landscape, in 2016, new threats rose to power, such as Mirai, LuaBot, Rex, PNScan, LizardStresser, Hajime, and others
No similarities with Hajime either
 Vesselin Bontchev, who says that despite the familiar sounding name, Imeij has nothing in common with Hajime, a malware family spotted for the first time in mid-October last year
"Hajime is a worm
"Hajime uses the name '
 Bontchev has been keeping an eye on Hajime versions, which are now very different from the versions first released in October last year
 According to Cybereason researchers, recent Hajime versions are modifying local firewall rules to keep other IoT malware out and prolong its stay on the infected device
Besides Imeij, Mirai, and Hajime, other IoT malware families that target the ARM platform, very popular with IoT makers, are LuaBot and Umbreon
The company noted that, like the Umbreon rootkit and the LuaBot malware, Imeij targets ARM-based hardware, which is widely used for IoT and mobile devices
LuaBot falls into the same category as Mirai because its primary purpose is to compromise Linux systems, IoT devices or web servers, and add them as bots inside a bigger botnet controlled by the attacker
LuaBot most likely used for DDoS attacks
At the moment, the LuaBot trojan is packed as an ELF binary that targets ARM platforms, usually found in embedded (IoT) devices
 One day after publishing his research on LuaBot, MalwareMustDie received an extra sample, a LuaBot module, which when installed, granted LauBot the ability to carry out Layer 7 DDoS attacks
Unlike Mirai, which is the fruit of a two-year-long coding frenzy, LuaBot is in its early stages of development, with the first detection being reported only a week ago and a zero detection rate on VirusTotal for current samples
LuaBot author challenges security researchers
The researcher also found that LuaBot's brazen developer left a message behind for all the infosec professionals trying to deconstruct his code
UPDATE [September 6, 2016]: Article was updated to include later analysis of the LuaBot DDoS module
Previously, security researchers have discovered Linux malware coded in languages such as Go (Rex) and Lua (LuaBot), but most of it is coded in C or C++ (Mirai)
