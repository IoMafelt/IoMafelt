While for many years the GafGyt malware strain dominated the IoT malware landscape, in 2016, new threats rose to power, such as Mirai, LuaBot, Rex, PNScan, LizardStresser, Hajime, and others
No similarities with Hajime either
 Vesselin Bontchev, who says that despite the familiar sounding name, Imeij has nothing in common with Hajime, a malware family spotted for the first time in mid-October last year
"Hajime is a worm
"Hajime uses the name '
 Bontchev has been keeping an eye on Hajime versions, which are now very different from the versions first released in October last year
 According to Cybereason researchers, recent Hajime versions are modifying local firewall rules to keep other IoT malware out and prolong its stay on the infected device
Besides Imeij, Mirai, and Hajime, other IoT malware families that target the ARM platform, very popular with IoT makers, are LuaBot and Umbreon
One of the latest additions to the IoT malware market is a trojan codenamed Linux/NyaDrop, recently reverse engineered by MalwareMustDie, the same researcher who discovered the Mirai malware
NyaDrop dropped via brute-force attacks on Telnet ports
Just like most IoT malware nowadays, NyaDrop's author relies on brute-forcing Internet-exposed IoT devices using their default credentials
NyaDrop is just a dropper for the Nya malware
If the brute-force attacker manages to authenticate on the device, a script executes a series of automated commands that download and execute the NyaDrop binary
Successful brute-force attack login which ends with attacker dropping NyaDrop
The NyaDrop trojan is very small in size
NyaDrop's purpose is to probe the system and decide if to download the actual malware, which is an ELF (Linux-specific) binary called "nya," hence the malware's name of NyaDrop
NyaDrop only targets MIPS architectures
MalwareMustDie says that NyaDrop will open a backdoor on the infected device and download the Nya trojan if the IoT device uses a MIPS 32-bit architecture for its CPU
The reason for the MIPS check is most likely that the NyaDrop author hasn't created fully functional payloads for other IoT platforms and wants to avoid infecting "useless" platforms, wasting bandwidth, and leaving strange binaries on systems it can't use
 The NyaDrop author can decide to push new payloads to NyaDrop-infected devices, which can have different capabilities, from the ability to launch DDoS attacks to working as proxies for all sorts of web traffic, masking an attacker's location
NyaDrop author very careful not to get caught
"This one [NyaDrop] was also made by [a] Russian actor," MalwareMustDie told Softpedia after analyzing the malware
 He also says that NyaDrop is capable of detecting honeypot environments, in which case it stops execution
very lucky to finally know the [NyaDrop] scheme

LuaBot
11 percent market share, this is our third story on Linux malware in the past 24 hours, after previously reporting on the Mirai DDoS trojan and the Umbreon rootkit
LuaBot falls into the same category as Mirai because its primary purpose is to compromise Linux systems, IoT devices or web servers, and add them as bots inside a bigger botnet controlled by the attacker
LuaBot most likely used for DDoS attacks
At the moment, the LuaBot trojan is packed as an ELF binary that targets ARM platforms, usually found in embedded (IoT) devices
 One day after publishing his research on LuaBot, MalwareMustDie received an extra sample, a LuaBot module, which when installed, granted LauBot the ability to carry out Layer 7 DDoS attacks
Unlike Mirai, which is the fruit of a two-year-long coding frenzy, LuaBot is in its early stages of development, with the first detection being reported only a week ago and a zero detection rate on VirusTotal for current samples
LuaBot author challenges security researchers
The researcher also found that LuaBot's brazen developer left a message behind for all the infosec professionals trying to deconstruct his code
UPDATE [September 6, 2016]: Article was updated to include later analysis of the LuaBot DDoS module
The rootkit's name is Umbreon, taken after the name of a Pokemon creature that hides in the shadows, a fitting name for a rootkit
Attacker installs Umbreon by hand, on each device
According to Trend Micro, threat actors have used Umbreon in live attacks, the company receiving samples to analyze from compromised devices
The good news is that Umbreon's installation is not automated, and attackers need to break into a system first, and then manually install the rootkit on the hacked device
Umbreon hooks into libc and libpcap
Detecting Umbreon is not an easy task at all
 As such, tools coded in these languages won't be able to detect Umbreon, who will be able to identify any search commands for its folder or location, hide itself, and then use libc to tamper with the results
Umbreon, which is a ring 3 (user level) rootkit, is somewhat easy to remove compared to a ring 0 rootkit, but non-technical administrators may break their OS if they're not careful
Attackers can use Umbreon to open SSH tunnels to infected hosts
As for its technical capabilities, Umbreon is a very dangerous tool, with the ability to persist between reboots, intercept all network traffic, intercept and alter terminal commands, and even open a connection to the attacker, allowing him to log on the victim's device
Just like Umbreon hooks into libc to intercept terminal commands, the rootkit also hooks into libpcap in order to intercept network traffic and hide its C&C communications, and the attacker's SSH sessions
 Trend Micro says the threat actor has been active since at least 2013, and that he started developing Umbreon in early 2015
 Softpedia understands that the source code of an older Umbreon version (2
