 Recently, we discovered a bot that combines the capabilities of Tsunami (also known as Kaiten) and Gafgyt
A prominent feature of Linux/Gafgyt is telnet scanning
Most of these capabilities are from Linux/Tsunami with the remainder from Linux/Gafgyt
 Analysis reveal the description of that command by the malware author is correct: it is indeed an improved version Gafgyt¡¯s telnet scanner
 We have seen this technique before being used to spread malware between embedded Linux devices, such as in Linux/Moose
2 is the fact that it also executes a wget/tftp command to download a shell script that downloads the bot binaries, just like Gafgyt usually does
The shell script is distributed via another server, which was also providing the popular Gafgyt bots
Perhaps it is a way to take revenge: MalwareMustDie is publishing a lot of details about Gafgyt, Tsunami and so on
